OpenSC Release 0.8.1
====================

We are pleased to announce the availability of OpenSC 0.8.1.

OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations,
and facilitate their use in security applications such as mail encryption,
authentication, and digital signature.

OpenSC can be used with the following applications and libraries:

 -	Netscape Communicator and Mozilla (through its PKCS#11 module),
 	for secure email (SMIME) and SSL authentication
 -	OpenSSH, for user authentication
 -	FreeSWAN, for authentication and key management
 -	OpenSSL, for key and certificate storage, key generation and
 	signing of certificate requests
 -	GNUpg 1.9 (experimental), for key storage
 -	Smart card login, through a PAM module
 -	Using the included utilities, to perform RSA decryption and
 	digitial signing

OpenSC is capable of personalizing various types of smart cards, but
also works with personalized cards such as the Finnish FINEID.

OpenSC can currently be used on Linux, Windows and MacOS X. It supports
PC/SC, CTAPI and OpenCT to talk to card terminals.
