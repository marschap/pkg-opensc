OpenSC Release 0.9.6
====================

We are pleased to announce the availability of OpenSC 0.9.6.

This new releases fixes many small issues found in the last six months.
The bigger changes are:
 - you need to have an opensc.conf config file. On Unix this is 
   $(sysconfdir)/opensc.conf depending on your --configure option.
   Users can have their own config file by setting the OPENSC_CONF
   evironment variable. On windows either the registry key
   HKLM\Software\OpenSC\ConfigFile or HKLU\Software\OpenSC\ConfigFile
   needs to be set and point to your config file.
 - your config file needs to have a "profile_dir" setting pointing
   to the installation directory with the "*.profile" files.
   Under Unix/Linux the configure script will create an etc/opensc.conf
   file for your with the right directory in it, simply copy it to
   your $(sysconfdir).
 - There is a new project "smart card bundle" to create a simple windows
   installer package containing OpenSSL, OpenSC and Putty with smart card
   patches, so you can simply download, install, and start using smart cards.
