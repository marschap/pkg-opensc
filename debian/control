Description: SmartCard utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards
 This package includes utilities for manipulating
 PKCS#15 compatible smart cards and similar security tokens
 with the libopensc libraries.
 .
 These utilities allow the user to initialize, personalize and
 otherwise manipulate PKCS#15 cards with PINs and cryptographic 
 keys.  Users can sign and decrypt data with private keys 
 residing on-card.
 .
 Supported cards include Gemplus GPK, Schlumberger Cryptoflex,
 Finnish FINEID, Swedish eID, MioCOS and TCOS cards.

Description: Pluggable Authentication Module for using PKCS#15 Smart Cards
 This package allows an administrator to configure a host to
 cryptographically authenticate users via PKCS#15 smart cards.
 User public keys can be stored in LDAP or in user home directories.
 User private keys are PIN-protected on issued smartcards.
 .
 This module supports any security token supported by the libopensc libraries.
 .
 Card initialization can be performed by utilities in the opensc package.
