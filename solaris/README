Creating an installable package for Solaris 10
==============================================

The files in this directory are an attempt to ease
the building of opensc packages for Solaris 10.

The basic steps to create a Solaris 10 package are:
# make build
# make dist
# make package

NOTE: If you are using the GNU compiler you will
      need to adjust the Makefile accordingly.
