usbtoken is no longer active developed.
Please use openct
	http://www.opensc.org/files/
	
I will support usbtoken for a short while, and
fix any bugs reported. But most likely usbtoken
will be removed from opensc in 0.9.0. So the
sooner you migrate to openct the better.

Sorry for causing this inconvinience.

Regards, Andreas
