ask-for-pin.diff
	SSH can't ask for the pin of a smart card in version 3.8.1p1.
	Fixing this is a major task and requires some kind of redesign
	in openssh as far as we understand, so please have patience.

	Meanwhile this patch can add the desired functionality, but
	it is a crude hack, not meant to be added to openssh releases.
