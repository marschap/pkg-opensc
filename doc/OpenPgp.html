<p>
OpenPGP 1.0 cards should work fine with OpenSC.
</p>
<p>
However right now the openpgp card can only be modified with gnupg.
So you need to use gnupg to use it / create keys / store keys etc.
</p>
<p>
In theory opensc has an emulation that can be used so we can
use those keys on the card, too, but in practice I haven't heard
of anyone using it successfully for a long time. If you find time
to test, please report back, both success or failure, so we can
have a look.
</p>
<p>
Also I'm not sure how good the other applications will work with that card.
nearly every app (except gnupg) expects some x.509 certificate on the
card and I have no idea if those can be created and/or stored with gnupg
on the card. But I think they can - at linuxtag I saw diagrams at the bsi
booth that indicate gnupg can do both pgp and smime so I guess it can
handle it.
</p>
<p>
Latest information indicates the card cannot store X.509 certificates.
Thus most applications will not be able to use it. Also remember the
card is limited to a maximum of three RSA keys, and the keys are limited
to 1024 bit size.
