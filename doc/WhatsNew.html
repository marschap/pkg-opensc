<p>
OpenSC has split into several smaller parts so maintenance becomes easier:
</p>
<ul><li><a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/opensc" href="http://www.opensc.org/opensc" shape="rect">OpenSC</a> itself - the opensc and pkcs15init library, the PKCS#11 module and the tools.
</li><li><a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/libp11" href="http://www.opensc.org/libp11" shape="rect">libp11</a> - a new library designed to make using smart cards easier. Works with OpenSC PKCS#11 and every other PKCS#11 module.
</li><li><a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/pam_p11" href="http://www.opensc.org/pam_p11" shape="rect">pam_p11</a> - a new plugable authenticaion module so you can log in with your smart card. Uses libp11.
</li><li><a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/engine_pkcs11" href="http://www.opensc.org/engine_pkcs11" shape="rect">engine_pkcs11</a> - the well known sslengine for using PKCS#11 modules is now a standalone project. It also uses libp11.
</li></ul><p>
The last major OpenSC release was nearly a year ago. With several smaller modules we hope to
release new versions much faster.
</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
OpenSC documentation is now managed in the wiki web page at <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/opensc/" href="http://www.opensc.org/opensc/" shape="rect">http://www.opensc.org/opensc/</a>.
The old manual is still included, but it is deprecated and all content will be moved to the
wiki page (most likely all content is already there).
</p>
<p>
OpenSC man pages are now in xml format and rendered to man and html. The tar file includes
both versions, the html version is also online at <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/doc/opensc/html/" href="http://www.opensc.org/doc/opensc/html/" shape="rect">http://www.opensc.org/doc/opensc/html/</a>
</p>
<h2>Incompatible</h2>
<p>
You need to recompile applications using OpenSC as the ABI changed. OpenSC 0.9.* had the library
version 1.0.0, OpenSC 0.10.* uses library version 2.0.0. Also you need to upgrade your config file,
as we added some new sections / parameters. Most important: you need to point to your profile dir
using that setting in your config file.
</p>
<p>
Now OpenSC installs all libraries and opensc-pkcs11.so in the lib/ directory. Older versions installed
those files in lib/, in lib/opensc/ or in lib/pkcs11/ and caused some confusion, or even didn't work
at all. Now all files are in lib/. If you have applications using opensc-pkcs11.so, you might need
to adjust the configuration to reflect this change.
</p>
<h2>New drivers</h2>
<p>
New drivers include the belpic driver for belgium eid cards (thanks to Belgium and Zetes),
the atrust-acos driver for Austrian eID cards (thanks to A-Trust) and an improved
tcos driver for tcos cards including german signature cards (thanks to Peter Koch).
</p>
<h2>New Pinpad support</h2>
<p>
OpenSC now implements the new PCSC v2 Part 10 standard for entering pins on the pinpad
(thanks to Martin Paljak).
</p>
<h2>New Windows binaries</h2>
<p>
Maybe you already noticed, we now have a new windows package called
<a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/scb/" href="http://www.opensc.org/scb/" shape="rect">smart card bundle</a> containing OpenSC, OpenSSL,
Putty and Pageant, so you can use smart cards on windows easily. 
We also highly recommend the <a class="ext-link" title="http://csp11.labs.libre-entreprise.org/" href="http://csp11.labs.libre-entreprise.org/" shape="rect">CSP#11</a>
cryptographic software provider for windows, so you can use OpenSC
with native applications like Internet Explorer or Outlook.
</p>
<h2>New installer for Apple Mac OS X</h2>
<p>
This is a new package. This is in early stage, and does currently only include 
OpenSC, we will add more parts in future version. More info <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/sca/" href="http://www.opensc.org/sca/" shape="rect">here</a>
