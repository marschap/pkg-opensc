OpenSC up to 0.9.6 included its own pam module pam_opensc.
This module was removed in OpenSC 0.10.0.
</p>
<p>
Instead you can use either of these pam modules:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/pam_p11/" shape="rect">Pam_p11</a> is a very simple pam module, perfect for small and simple setups (no ca, no crl, no signature checks,
</li></ul><blockquote>

<p>
simply authenticating with the keys you added to a file). Pam_p11 contains two modules: pam_p11_opensc and pam_p11_openssh.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>pam_p11_opensc is the successor of the old pam_opensc module (eid mode). simply add certificates in pem format to the .eid/authorized_certificates file and any smart card with a matching certificate and key can login.
</li><li>pam_p11_openssh looks at .ssh/authorized_keys format (the well known openssh file), and lets a user login, if he has a smart card with a matching key.
</li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/pam_pkcs11/" shape="rect">Pam_PKCS11</a> is fully featured, it does all those ca checks, can work with ldap, kerberos and other
mechanisms and has many different so called mappers for a very flexible mapping of smart cards to users.
</li></ul></div>
