<p>
On Win32 a pinpad reader usually supplies a PC/SC driver and a CT-API driver, since pinpad usage with PC/SC currently is vendor specific. There are some rumours about pinpad standardisation for PC/SC drivers, but I guess this will still need some time till it is widely adopted. Another alternative would be to use the CCID specification for USB readers, but there still are (and IMHO will be for some time) lots of non-CCID compliant pinpad readers.
</p>
<p>
So till another standard finds its way into OpenSC you can try the somewhat less user friendly CT-API if you want to use your pinpad with OpenSC.
</p>
<h2 id="ConfiguringCT-APIinopensc.conf">Configuring CT-API in opensc.conf</h2>
<p>
To activate the CT-API driver you have to add the token "ctapi" to the reader_drivers attribute of the app default section (or whatever app you are using). 
Then the reader's parameters, that is the library and port number, have to be configured in the "reader_driver ctapi" secion.
</p>
<p>
Use this as an example:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">  app default {
    reader_drivers = ctapi;
    reader_driver ctapi {
      module c:\winnt\system32\CTRSCT32.DLL {
        ports = 1;
      }
    }

  # All the other OpenCT-Parameters...
  .
  .
  .
  }
</pre><p>
<strong>Notes</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>For some readers you can look up the module name in <a class="wiki" href="PinpadReaders.html" shape="rect">pinpad reader overview</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li>Some drivers use port number 0 for the first reader, others start counting with 1.
</li></ul><ul><li>You can use multiple readers. Just add more "module"-sections if they use other drivers or add port numbers with a comma for the same driver. You can even mix PC/SC drivers and CT-API drivers for different readers.
</li></ul><ul><li>The same approach should work with Unix if you can find the CT-API library for your reader.
</li></ul><p>
After this you can try "opensc-tool -l" and hope to see something like
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">C:\work\opensc\src\tools&gt;opensc-tool -l
Readers known about:
Nr.    Driver     Name
0      ctapi      CT-API c:\winnt\system32\CTRSCT32.DLL, port 1
</pre><p>
If you are using a pinpad aware application (I still don't know any except my private pintest) you are ready. Some other applications (like the PKCS#11 plugin for Mozilla or the <a class="missing wiki" href="OpensslEngines.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">OpensslEngines?</a>) will use the pinpad if you hit return after being asked for a PIN.
</p>
<p>
Note that up to date PIN modification or unblocking is not supported with CT-API driver, there still is some work to do... ;)
