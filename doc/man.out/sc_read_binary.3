.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function reads from a transparent elementary file (EF) on
\fIcard\fR\&. It corresponds to the ISO 7816 READ BINARY function\&. Call
sc_select_file()
first to select the file to read from\&.
.PP
The data read from the file is stored in
\fIbuf\fR, which is
\fIcount\fR
bytes long\&.
.PP
The
\fIoffset\fR
argument specifies the file offset in bytes\&. The
\fIflags\fR
argument is currently not used, and should be set to 0\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
If successful, the number of bytes read is returned\&. Otherwise, a negative value is returned\&.
