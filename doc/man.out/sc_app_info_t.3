.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This structure describes a smart card application\&. It contains the following members:
.PP
\fIaid\fR
.RS 4
The applications\'s AID\&. An AID uniquely identifies an application, and consists of an RID (a 5\-byte "Registered Application Provider Identifier") and a PIX, which identifies an application by that provider\&. For example, the RID for PKCS#15 consists of the bytes A0 00 00 00 63, and the PIX is the string "PKCS\-15"\&. Thus, the AID of a PKCS#15 application on a smart card is A0 00 00 00 63 50 4B 43 53 2D 31\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIaid_len\fR
.RS 4
The length of the AID in bytes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIlabel\fR
.RS 4
A UTF\-8 string describing the application\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIpath\fR
.RS 4
The application\'s full path on the card, starting at the MF\&.

\fIddo\fR

\fIddo_len\fR

\fIdesc\fR

\fIrec_nr\fR
.RS 4
If the EF(DIR) file is record\-structured, this has the record number in which this application is stored\&. Otherwise, this is \-1\&.
