.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function writes a record that is
\fIbuflen\fR
bytes long from the buffer pointed to by
\fIbuf\fR
to a record\-structured elementary file (EF) on
\fIcard\fR\&. The function corresponds to the ISO 7816 WRITE RECORD function\&. Call
sc_select_file()
first to select the file to write to\&.
.PP

\fIrecord\fR
specifies the ID of the record to be written, or, if
\fIflags\fR
is set to
SC_RECORD_BY_REC_NR, the record number\&. If
\fIrecord\fR
is set to zero, the current record will be read\&.
.PP
This function is used for newly created files only; for updating or appending to existing files, see the
sc_update_record()
and
sc_append_record()
functions, respectively\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Returns the number of bytes written if successful, or a negative value in case of error\&.
