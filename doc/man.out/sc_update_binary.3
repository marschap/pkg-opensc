.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function writes
\fIcount\fR
bytes from the buffer pointed to by
\fIbuf\fR
to a transparent elementary file (EF) on
\fIcard\fR\&. It corresponds to the ISO 7816 UPDATE BINARY function\&. Call
sc_select_file()
first to select the file to write to\&.
.PP
This function can only be used to write to a file region previously written to\&. For writing to a newly created file, or a new region of an existing file, use
sc_write_binary()\&.
.PP
The
\fIoffset\fR
argument specifies the file offset in bytes\&. The
\fIflags\fR
argument is currently not used, and should be set to 0\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
If successful, the number of bytes written is returned\&. Otherwise, a negative value is returned\&.
