.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function constructs a single entry in an ASN\&.1 stream, at the buffer pointed to by
\fIout\fR
(which is
\fIoutlen\fR
bytes long)\&. The tag to be used is in
\fItag\fR, and the entry payload is pointed to by
\fIdata\fR, which is
\fIdatalen\fR
bytes long\&.
.PP
If
\fInextbuf\fR
is not NULL, it will be filled in with a pointer to the buffer address immediately following the newly copied entry\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Returns 0 if successful, or a negative value in case of error\&.
