All Mozilla applications can use OpenSC PKCS#11 module "opensc-pkcs11.so" for authentication, signing and decryption.
</p>
<p>
A step by step guide how to install the OpenSC PKCS#11 module here: <a class="wiki" href="/opensc/wiki/MozillaSteps" shape="rect">MozillaSteps</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once the module is installed you can use it to access web pages with https and client certificates.
Firefox will ask you to provide a certificate and you can select one from your smart card.
</p>
<p>
Keypair generation, certificate request
and writing the requested cert through an on-line CA should also be <a class="wiki" href="/opensc/wiki/pkcs11_keypair_gen" shape="rect">possible</a>.
</p>
<p>
In Thunderbird and Mozilla Mail you can select the certificate for signing and decryption exactly
like you would do with normal certificates.
</p>
<p>
Note: some people do not recommend to use smart card with email encryption&amp;decryption, unless you
have a way to backup your private key. It would be a pity if your smart card was damaged and
you had no way to decrypt private emails.
