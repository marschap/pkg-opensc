<h2 id="Version2.3">Version 2.3</h2>
<p>
Version 2.3 is supported by OpenSC.to be precise: iKey 3000 which contains Starcos).
The <a class="wiki" href="StarKey.html" shape="rect">StarKey</a> 100 (USB) token from G&amp;D  doesn't seem to work. It features Starcos SPK 2.3, but adding
usb:096e/0005 to the ikey3k driver ids in openct.conf still won't access the card.
</p>
<p>
Currently only Starcos SPK 2.3 is tested. If you have a newer version, please report back.
</p>
<h2 id="Version3.0">Version 3.0</h2>
<p>
Version 3.0 is not supported by the OpenSC Starcos driver yet.
</p>
<h2 id="Version3.1">Version 3.1</h2>
<p>
There also seems to be Version 3.1 which only does ECC signatures instead of RSA. This is not yet supported by OpenSC as well.
</p>
<p>
G&amp;D is a very nice company, their APDU manuals are public available, all you need to do
is send an email asking for them, and they send you the latest version. This is great!
Thanks G&amp;D!

<h1 id="Erasingcards">Erasing cards</h1>
<p>
Only test cards with StarCOS are erasable. If the last byte of the return
value of "opensc-tool -s 80:f6:00:01" is 0x00 the card is afaik not
erasable, if it's 0xc0 it should be erasble. 
</p>
<p>
Eutron <a class="missing wiki" shape="rect">CryptoIdendity?</a> ITSEC-P tokens contain normal cards and thus are not eraseable.
