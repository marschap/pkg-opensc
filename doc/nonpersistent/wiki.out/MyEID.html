<p>
Aventra MyEID PKI Card is a cryptographic smart card conforming to common Public Key Infrastructure standards like ISO7816 and PKCS#15. It can be used for various tasks requiring strong cryptography, e. g. logging securely to Windows, encrypting e-mail, authentication, and electronic signatures. The card is also available as a Dual Interface version, compatible with T=CL protocol and also emulating Mifare™.
</p>
<p>
The card material is PVC as standard, making it suitable for visual personalisation using thermal transfer or dye sublimation printers. Customer specific layouts can be delivered in offset and silk screen printing. Optional features include magnetic stripe, signature panel, holograms, security printing etc. 
</p>
<p>
The cards can be personalised both visually and electrically by Aventra according to customer specifications, or the customers can personalise the cards themselves using ActivePerso Manager developed by Aventra, or software from other parties.

<p>
The MyEID applet implements all the basic functionality of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) token specified in the most common international PKI standards, such as PKCS#15.  The users optionally have a choice between different authentication methods to the token. Besides the standard PIN number, there are currently two other authentication mechanisms available. The GrIDsure® one time PIN is based on a pop-up challenge grid that is used to form a onetime PIN that cannot be used by outsiders watching the authentication. MyEID tokens are also compatible with PalmSecure™ biometric technology, which is based on the unique blood vein patterns in the palm of the user’s hand replacing the PIN. The MyEID applet is compatible with the Aventra ActiveSecurity Client Suite.

<p>
OpenSC 0.11.4 was the first version that had support for the MyEID card. At that time the patch required was provided by Aventra when requested. Since the version 0.11.10 support for the MyEID card is included to the official release. PKCS#15 initialization is not supported.
</p>
<p>
In OpenSC only normal PIN codes can be used. GrIDsure® and PalmSecure technologies are not supported. These require our ActiveSecurity MyClient software.
</p>
<h3 id="Smartcardreaderconfiguration">Smart card reader configuration</h3>
<p>
MyEID card uses T=1 protocol. This basically means that the response data is sent with the answer to the command/request. In T=0 protocol the smart card will first answer to the command and tell how much data it will send. Data is then sent separately. 
</p>
<p>
Most readers don't support sending the default amount of data (254). Problems will only appear when reading larger files from the card (e.g. certificates). So if you have problems with reading the card with no apparent reason, try set this to 192, be on the safe side. You can then try to iterate to find the maximum for your card reader. 
</p>
<p>
The setting in the opensc.conf (usually in /etc) config file is the following for the used reader:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">...
	reader_driver pcsc {
		# This sets the maximum send and receive sizes.
		# Some reader drivers have limitations, so you need
		# to set these values. For usb devices check the
		# properties with lsusb -vv for dwMaxIFSD
		#
		# max_send_size = 254;
		# max_recv_size = 254;
		max_recv_size = 192;
...		
	}

	reader_driver openct {
...
		# max_send_size = 252;
		# max_recv_size = 252;
		max_recv_size = 192;
...
	};
