<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.ftsafe.com/" shape="rect"><span class="icon">Feitian</span></a> offers the <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.ftsafe.com/products/PKI-Card.html" shape="rect"><span class="icon">FTCOS/PK-01C</span></a> which also be called PKI card.
</p>
<p>
The driver of FTCOS/PK-01C in OpenSC is called "entersafe". It's supported in 0.11.8 and later version.
</p>
<p>
Feitian has their own software for windows, cards writen by Feitian can be read by OpenSC, and vice versa. 
Since Feitian's software support PKCS11 and windows CAPI, cards writen by it can not be writen any more by OpenSC, and vice versa.
