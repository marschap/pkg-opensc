<a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a>® USB Token
</p>
<p>
The user-friendly combination of chip card and card reader
</p>
<p>
<a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a> USB Token belongs to a new generation of manipulation-proof IT security products, designed for costeffective use in PKI systems. It combines the security features of a chip card with the advantages of USB devices. <a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a> USB Token contributes to the improved efficiency of IT applications, reduces costs, and offers optimum flexibility. The token is small, light, and so conveniently sized that it fits on a key chain. It requires no additional reader since it connects directly to the PC via USB interface. In many environments, such as Wireless LAN, it can be used for authentication as an alternative or supplement to the conventional combination of chip card and reader.

<p>
An intelligent solution that ensures high-level security
</p>
<p>
Two-factor authentication ensures that the user can only access the system with the combination of <a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a> USB Token and PIN. Unless both match, the user is not authorized to access the corresponding applications and data. <a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a> USB Token offers recognized and certified security. Sensitive information is securely saved on the token. All actions, e.g. encryption or digital signatures, are executed on the token itself. This ensures that private keys cannot be read or copied from the token. Compared to software-based solutions, this provides a considerably higher level of security.
</p>
<p>
Flash memory for saving further data
</p>
<p>
On request the <a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a> USB Token is available with additional flash memory. It does not only securely store the user’s data such as personal profiles and X.509 digital certificates, but also offers the user a memory capacity of up to 1 GB. This can be used for saving further data and applications.
