As <a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a> is afaik a PKCS15 compliant 
profile it should be supported in OpenSC. However due to a bug in an older version of the <a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a> software 
used for at least for some tokens the profile on these tokens are not PKCS15 compliant and hence these
smartcards are currently not supported in OpenSC.
</p>
<p>
To implement a workaround for these tokens shouldn't be too difficult, however due to a lack of test tokens
it hasn't been implemented yet. If you have one of these tokens and are interested in OpenSC support for it
please send a mail to opensc-devel@…. The related ticket is <a class="closed ticket" href="/opensc/ticket/30" title="defect: pkcs11 of opensc not yet supporting Taiwan's Citizen Digital IC card due ... (closed: worksforme)" shape="rect">#30</a>
