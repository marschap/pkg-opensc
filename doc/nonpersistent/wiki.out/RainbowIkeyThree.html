<p>
<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.rainbow.com/" shape="rect"><span class="icon"> </span>Rainbow</a> offers the iKey 3000, an USB crypto token with 32k memory
and support for RSA keys up to 1024bit key length.
</p>
<p>
The iKey 3000 is fully supported by OpenSC and is well tested.
</p>
<p>
The smart card inside is a starcos card by Giesecke &amp; Devrient.
</p>
<p>
One minor feature of Starcos is that a pin can only be unblocked if it is blocked. For this reason the regression test pin0002 fails, but this is a harmless and known issue, so please ignore.
</p>
<p>
Rainbow iKey 3000 is bundled with <a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a> software by A.E.T. (exactly the A.E.T. middleware is called SafeSign) which follows the PKCS#15 standard. Thus key
can be initialized with either OpenSC or <a class="wiki" href="StarSign.html" shape="rect">StarSign</a> and will work with both.
</p>
<p>
Documentation for the Starcos Smartcard is available to the public. Send those nice folks at G&amp;D an email
and they will send you the latest manual.
