<p>
The oberthur driver supports Oberthur 64k Java-cards in the Versions v4/2.1.1, v5 and v5/2.2.0 and CosmopolIC v5.2/2.2,
that contains applet AuthentIC. 
</p>
<p>
The driver was written by Viktor Tarasov of Idealx. Thanks for donating this driver!
</p>
<p>
The last fully tested driver is included into OpenSC-0.9.6 .  
</p>
<p>
The OpenSC Oberthur driver is fully tested but not widely used. 
</p>
<p>
<i> "Industrial"</i>  driver includes support of the native Oberthur's AWP (and so, the smartcard can be used with both OpenSC and Oberthur's Windows middleware).
It also uses Mozilla style for the choice of pkcs15 object ID. The reason is that in some applications the smartcard personalization is finalized and then smartcard is used 
with web-browsers and PKI environment.
