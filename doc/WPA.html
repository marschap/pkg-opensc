    <div id="searchable"><h1>Wireless authentication</h1>
<p>
Wireless network used to be protected by the WEP standard, but WEP turned out to be insecure and thus useless.
These days wireless networks are usualy protected using WPA - Wi-Fi Protected Access.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunatly WPA is available in several flavors and versions, see
the <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.wi-fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp" href="http://www.wi-fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp" shape="rect">Wi-Fi Alliance website</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
If your wireless network is set up to ask for authentication using client certificates,
then you can use it with those certificates and keys on your smart card.
</p>
<p>
For windows the windows build in WPA client should work well, if you have a CSP installed that works with OpenSC.
This is untested, please report your results.
</p>
<p>
For linux you can use the <a class="ext-link" title="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/" href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/" shape="rect">WPA Supplicant</a> or <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.open1x.org/" href="http://www.open1x.org/" shape="rect">Xsupplicant</a> with OpenSC.
The support for smart cards is implemented in both via the <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/engine_pkcs11/" href="http://www.opensc.org/engine_pkcs11/" shape="rect">PKCS#11 Engine for OpenSSL</a>.
</p>
<h2>WPA Supplicant</h2>
<p>
To use WPA Suppplicant with smart card authentication you need to compile it with smart card support. Your config file should include this line:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve"># Smartcard support (i.e., private key on a smartcard), e.g., with openssl
# engine.
CONFIG_SMARTCARD=y
</pre><p>
Also you need to edit wpa_supplicant.conf like this:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve"># OpenSSL Engine support
# These options can be used to load OpenSSL engines.
# make the pkcs11 engine available
pkcs11_engine_path=/usr/lib/engine/engine_pkcs11.so
# configure the path to the pkcs11 module required by the pkcs11 engine
pkcs11_module_path=/usr/lib/engine/opensc-pkcs11.so
</pre><h2>X Supplicant</h2>
<p>
It looks like xsupplicant is always compiled with smart card support.
</p>
<p>
To enable it, edit the xsupplicant.conf config file and look for lines
like these:
</p>
<pre class="wiki" xml:space="preserve">     # this section configures the smartcard used with eap-tls
     # for now the smartcard PIN is handled the same way as the 
     # password for a private key
     smartcard {
        # this line actually enables the smartcard and makes xsupplicant use
        # the opensc engine
        engine_id = pkcs11
        # set the path to the engine
        opensc_so_path = "/usr/lib/engine/engine_pkcs11.so"
        # set the key id on the smartcard
        key_id = 45
     }
</pre><p>
FIXME: someone should test this and check if it works as advertised.
