<ul><li>Most people can use the packages provided by your distribution (in the core or in the contrib section).
You probably want to install <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.openssl.org/" shape="rect"><span class="icon">OpenSSL</span></a>, <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/openct/" shape="rect">OpenCT</a>, <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/opensc/" shape="rect">OpenSC</a>, <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/libp11/" shape="rect">libp11</a>, <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/enigne_pkcs11" shape="rect">engine_pkcs11</a> and maybe <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/pam_p11" shape="rect">pam_p11</a> or <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/pam_pkcs11/" shape="rect">pam_pkcs11</a> for authentication
(or <a class="ext-link" href="http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/" shape="rect"><span class="icon">PCSC-Lite</span></a> and some driver for it instead of OpenCT).
</li></ul><ul><li>If you want to compile OpenSC, you need to install either OpenCT or PCSC-Lite first, to use those drivers/middleware.
Install both the runtime and the development package. Also it is highly suggested to install OpenSSL (including development)
as some smart card drivers require it. If you want to use the signer applet in mozilla, you also need libassuan from the
gnupg (like always, both runtime and development packages). See <a class="wiki" href="QuickStart.html" shape="rect">QuickStart</a> for configure options and testing if OpenSC works.
</li></ul><ul><li>Developers can work on tar.gz files, like the latest release, or the nightly snapshots provided on <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/files/opensc/snapshots/" shape="rect">http://www.opensc-project.org/files/opensc/snapshots/</a>
</li><li>Developers can also check out the current source code using subversion. See <a class="missing wiki" href="SubversionReposity.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">SubversionReposity?</a> for details. You will need autoconf,
automake and libtool at least. "make dist" uses wget to download the wiki and xsltproc to create html files and man pages, and svn
to create the <a class="missing wiki" href="ChangeLog.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ChangeLog?</a>.
</li></ul><h2 id="MacOSX">Mac OS X</h2>
<ul><li>Mac OS X installer is <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/sca" shape="rect">available</a> for 10.4.4 and later.
</li></ul><h2 id="Windows">Windows</h2>
<p>
 
</p>
<ul><li>Windows NT, 2000 and XP contains the windows smart card middleware. For older versions you can download it from
Microsoft.com (FIXME: Name, download link, ...)
</li></ul><ul><li>You might be best off with our installer package containing OpenSSL, OpenSC, Libp11, Engine_pkcs11 and Putty.
The latest version is available on at the <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/scb/" shape="rect">smart card bundle</a> project page.
</li></ul><ul><li>Note that applications like Outlook or Internet Explorer as well as many other Windows native application
use the so called Crypto API. If you combine OpenSC with a Crypto Service Provide those applications can
use Smart Cards  without any change. More details on the <a class="wiki" href="WindowsCSP.html" shape="rect">WindowsCSP</a> page.
