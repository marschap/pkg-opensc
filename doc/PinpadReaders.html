<p>
Pinpad support with OpenCT is still under development. If you want to test it you'll have to use development snapshots of OpenSC and will most probably run into difficulties and/or outright bugs. 
Reporting those bugs on the mailinglist may be a good way to get them fixed.

Currently Win32 and Unix versions follow quite different approaches, mainly due to availability of different drivers.
</p>
<p>
The Unix approach using CCID compliant readers is discribed in the <a href="CardReaders/SPR532.html" shape="rect">CardReaders/SPR532</a> document, I'll have a word about <a href="CardReaders/CTAPI.html" shape="rect">CT-API Readers</a> which are common on Win32 (if you have one on a Unix system please tell me!).
(martin: The 'ccid' in the spec is misleading - every ifdhandler can be changed to implement the teletrust spec - it uses a control block similar to CCID pin block but is _not_ pure ccid up to the lowest levels of the driver. And: the latest spr532 drivers for windows should follow the same spec and thus it _should_ work on windows. it is more tied to pcsc than it is tied to pure ccid)

<h2>Known and tested pinpad readers</h2>
<p>
Please feel free to add your hardware and experiences here.

<p>
Class 2 readers have a pinpad for secure pin entry. Sometimes they are plugged between computer and keyboard so they use the keyboard for pin entry but capture the keystrokes before they reach the computer.
</p>
<p>
Class 3 readers have pinpad and a display.

Kobil and OmniKey also offer pinpad readers, if someone could test one of those with OpenSC feedback would be appreceated.
