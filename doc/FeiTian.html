<h2 id="AboutFeitian">About Feitian</h2>
<p>
Feitian Technologies was organized in 1998 with the mission of creating world class software security products. Feitian expanded quickly. Within a few years it opened offices in Shanghai and Guangzhou. In 2003 it opened yet another office in Chengdu to provide strong coverage of the major markets on the China mainland. Feitian's product lines expanded as well. ROCKEY1 was among the first commercial dongles manufactured in China and reflected the leading standards of the time. Today Feitian has emerged as an innovator in the field. The ROCKEY5 dongle employs the latest in smart card technology. Feitian intends to continue to leverage its core competency in smart card related development to provide our customers with stronger and more flexible solutions for enforcing their licensing agreements.

In 2000 Feitian released the ePass1000 network authentication token along with its first PKCS and CAPI middleware for the Windows platform. Development on the ePass2000 token began several months later. ePass2000 uses a smart card to securely store digital certificates and internally process encryption algorithms.

The ROCKEY100 and ROCKEY200 smart card reader technology followed the ePass development efforts. ROCKEY100/200 are USB attached smart card readers that support the PC/SC interface and relevant ISO standards.

Today Feitian is a fast growing privately held firm with a growing stake in markets outside of China. Feitian's commitment to the IT security field may be seen in its growing roster of product lines and development partners.
