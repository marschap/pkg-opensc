<p>
All Cryptoflex cards are supported by OpenSC, tested very often and work fine.
</p>
<p>
Cryptoflex 8k cards however are too small, so the default profile does not fit on the card. Not even the small option is small enough to make it fit on the card. However you could edit the profile file to make it even smaller, then it should work again.
