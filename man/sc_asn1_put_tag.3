.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function constructs a single entry in an ASN.1 stream, at the buffer pointed to by
\fIout\fR
(which is
\fIoutlen\fR
bytes long). The tag to be used is in
\fItag\fR, and the entry payload is pointed to by
\fIdata\fR, which is
\fIdatalen\fR
bytes long.
.PP
If
\fInextbuf\fR
is not NULL, it will be filled in with a pointer to the buffer address immediately following the newly copied entry.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Returns 0 if successful, or a negative value in case of error.
