.PP


.nf

#include <opensc\&.h>

int sc_asn1_put_tag(int tag, const unsigned char *data, int datalen,

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This function constructs a single entry in an ASN\&.1 stream, at the buffer pointed to by\fIout\fR (which is \fIoutlen\fR bytes long)\&. The tag to be used is in \fItag\fR, and the entry payload is pointed to by \fIdata\fR, which is \fIdatalen\fR bytes long\&.

.PP
If \fInextbuf\fR is not NULL, it will be filled in with a pointer to the buffer address immediately following the newly copied entry\&.
