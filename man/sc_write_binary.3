.nf

#include <opensc\&.h>

int sc_write_binary(struct sc_card *card, unsigned int offset,

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This function writes \fIcount\fR bytes from the buffer pointed to by\fIbuf\fR to a transparent elementary file (EF) on \fIcard\fR\&. It corresponds to the ISO 7816 WRITE BINARY function\&. Call sc_select_file() first to select the file to write to\&.

.PP
This function is used to write to a newly created file, or to a a previously unused portion of a file\&. For updating an existing file, use the sc_update_binary() function\&.

.PP
The \fIoffset\fR argument specifies the file offset in bytes\&. The\fIflags\fR argument is currently not used, and should be set to 0\&.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

.PP
If successful, the number of bytes written is returned\&. Otherwise, a negative value is returned\&.
