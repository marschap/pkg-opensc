.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function writes
\fIcount\fR
bytes from the buffer pointed to by
\fIbuf\fR
to a transparent elementary file (EF) on
\fIcard\fR. It corresponds to the ISO 7816 WRITE BINARY function. Call
sc_select_file()
first to select the file to write to.
.PP
This function is used to write to a newly created file, or to a a previously unused portion of a file. For updating an existing file, use the
sc_update_binary()
function.
.PP
The
\fIoffset\fR
argument specifies the file offset in bytes. The
\fIflags\fR
argument is currently not used, and should be set to 0.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
If successful, the number of bytes written is returned. Otherwise, a negative value is returned.
