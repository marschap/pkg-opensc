.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
\fB\fR 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The \fBpkcs15\-init\fR utility for PKCS #15 smart card personalization is controlled via profiles\&. When starting, it will read two such profiles at the moment, a generic application profile, and a card specific profile\&. The generic profile must be specified on the command line, while the card\-specific file is selected based on the type of card detected\&.

.PP
The generic application profile defines general information about the card layout, such as the path of the application DF, various PKCS #15 files within that directory, and the access conditions on these files\&. It also defines general information about PIN, key and certificate objects\&. Currently, there is only one such generic profile, \fBpkcs15\&.profile\fR\&.

.PP
The card specific profile contains additional information required during card intialization, such as location of PIN files, key references etc\&. Profiles currently reside in \fB@pkgdata@\fR 

.SH "SYNTAX"

.PP
This section should contain information about the profile syntax\&. Will add this soonishly\&.
