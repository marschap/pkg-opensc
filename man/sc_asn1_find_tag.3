sc_asn1_find_tag \- Find a tag in an ASN.1 stream
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP


.nf

#include <opensc\&.h>

const unsigned char *sc_asn1_find_tag(struct sc_context *ctx,
                                      const unsigned char *buf, size_t buflen,

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This function tries to find an ASN\&.1 tag matching \fItag_in\fR in the buffer pointed to by \fIbuf\fR, which is of size \fIbuflen\fR\&. The buffer should contain a series of ASN\&.1 entries\&.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

.PP
If the specified tag was not found, NULL is returned\&. If found, the address where it was found is returned, and \fItaglen_in\fR is set to the length of the found tag\&.
