.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This structure describes a smart card application. It contains the following members:
.PP
aid
.RS 3n
The applications's AID. An AID uniquely identifies an application, and consists of an RID (a 5\-byte "Registered Application Provider Identifier") and a PIX, which identifies an application by that provider. For example, the RID for PKCS#15 consists of the bytes A0 00 00 00 63, and the PIX is the string "PKCS\-15". Thus, the AID of a PKCS#15 application on a smart card is A0 00 00 00 63 50 4B 43 53 2D 31.
.RE
.PP
aid_len
.RS 3n
The length of the AID in bytes.
.RE
.PP
label
.RS 3n
A UTF\-8 string describing the application.
.RE

path
.RS 3n
The application's full path on the card, starting at the MF.
