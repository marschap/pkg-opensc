.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function encodes an array of entries pointed to by
\fIasn1\fR
and terminated by a NULL entry (i.e. where the
name
field of the entry is NULL) into a newly allocated buffer.
.PP
The new buffer containing the ASN.1 stream will be stored in
\fInewbuf\fR, and the size of this buffer is stored in
\fIsize\fR. The application must free this buffer after use.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Returns 0 if successful, or a negative value in case of error.
