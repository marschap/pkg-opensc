Print the compiler flags that are needed to compile a program to use the OpenSC libraries\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-prefix=PREFIX\fR
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that OpenSC was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and \-\-libs options\&. This option is also used for the exec prefix if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified\&. This option must be specified before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options\&.

.TP
