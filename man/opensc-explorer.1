.SH NAME
opensc-explorer \- generic interactive utility for accessing smart card and similar security token functions
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.PP
\fBopensc\-explorer\fR [OPTIONS]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The \fBopensc\-explorer\fR utility can be used interactively to perform miscellaneous operations such as exploring the contents of or sending arbitrary APDU commands to a smart card or similar security token\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
The following are the command\-line options for\fBopensc\-explorer\fR\&. There are additional interactive commands available once it is running\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-reader\fR num, \fB\-r\fR num
Use the given reader number\&. The default is 0, the first reader in the system\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-card\-driver\fR driver, \fB\-c\fR driver
Use the given card driver\&. The default is auto\-detected\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-verbose, \-v\fR
Causes \fBopensc\-explorer\fR to be more verbose\&. Specify this flag several times to enable debug output in the opensc library\&.
 

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
The following commands are supported at the \fBopensc\-explorer\fR interactive prompt\&.

.TP
\fBls\fR
list all files in the current DF

.TP
\fBcd\fR \fIfile\-id\fR
change to another DF specified by \fIfile\-id\fR

.TP
\fBcat\fR
print the contents of the currently selected EF

.TP
\fBinfo\fR [\fIfile\-id\fR]
display attributes of a file specified by \fIfile\-id\fR\&. If \fIfile\-id\fR is not supplied, the attributes of the current file are printed\&.

.TP
\fBcreate\fR \fIfile\-id\fR \fIsize\fR
create a new EF\&. \fIfile\-id\fR specifies the id number and \fIsize\fR is the size of the new file\&.

.TP
\fBdelete\fR \fIfile\-id\fR
remove the EF or DF specified by \fIfile\-id\fR

.TP
\fBverify\fR \fIkey\-type\fR\fIkey\-id\fR [\fIkey\fR]
present a PIN or key to the card\&. Where \fIkey\-type\fR can be one of CHV, KEY or PRO\&. \fIkey\-id\fR is a number representing the key or PIN number\&. \fIkey\fR is the key or PIN to be verified in hex\&.

Example: verify CHV0 31:32:33:34:00:00:00:00

.TP
\fBchange CHV\fR\fIid [old\-pin] new\-pin\fR
change a PIN

Example: change CHV0 31:32:33:34:00:00:00:00 'secret'

.TP
\fBput\fR \fIfile\-id\fR [\fIinput\fR]
copy a local file to the card\&. The local file is specified by \fIinput\fR while the card file is specified by \fIfile\-id\fR 

.TP
\fBget\fR \fIfile\-id\fR [\fIoutput\fR]
copy an EF to a local file\&. The local file is specified by \fIoutput\fR while the card file is specified by \fIfile\-id\fR\&.

.TP
\fBmkdir\fR \fIfile\-id\fR \fIsize\fR
create a DF\&. \fIfile\-id\fR specifies the id number and \fIsize\fR is the size of the new file\&.

.TP
\fBpksign\fR
create a public key signature\&. NOTE: This command is currently not implemented\&.

.TP
\fBpkdecrypt\fR
perform a public key decryption\&. NOTE: This command is currently not implemented\&.

.TP
\fBerase\fR
erase the card, if the card supports it\&.

.TP
\fBdebug\fR [\fIlevel\fR]
get or set the debug level

.TP
\fBquit\fR
exit the program
